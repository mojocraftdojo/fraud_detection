# Modelling for Credit Card Fraud Detection

The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling the past credit card transactions with known fraud transactions. 

The goal for this project is to predict fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

The datasets contains more than 284k transactions and 30 features which most has already been PCA transformed, but there are still EDA work need to be done before modeling. 

The standard ML models tested and compared here are: 

   -- Logistic Regression
   
   -- Support Vector Machine
   
   -- Random Forest
   
   -- XGBoost
   
   -- CatBoost
   
   -- Gradient Boosting

The above models are built using Scikit-learn framework

On top of these, an Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) model is also trained to compare with the above models. This model is built suing Keras/Tensorflow2 framework.
