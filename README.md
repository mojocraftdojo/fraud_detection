# Building predictive models to detect Credit Card Fraud 

The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling the past credit card transactions with known fraud transactions. 

The goal for this project is to predict fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

The datasets contains more than 284k transactions and 30 features which most has already been PCA transformed, but there are still EDA work need to be done before modeling. 

The standard ML models tested and compared here are: 

   -- Logistic Regression
   
   -- Support Vector Machine
   
   -- Random Forest
   
   -- XGBoost
   
   -- CatBoost
   
   -- Gradient Boosting

These models are built using Scikit-learn framework

An additional Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) model is also trained to compare with the above models. The model is built using Keras/Tensorflow2 framework.
